👨🏻‍💻 I'm an Analytics Engineer at [Aruna](https://aruna.id). If you wonder what I do, I think this image explained it well enough 😉.

🧑🏻‍🎓 Previously, I completed BSc in Computer Science at [ESQ Business School](https://esqbs.ac.id)!

🐟 My experiences span multiple industries, including Fishery, Insurtech, and Telecom.

📚 I love reading more than anything. Mostly, about tech, finance and self improvement. You can find what I read on my [goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/178775383-ilyas-perlindungan) and what I write on my [medium](https://ilyaasp.medium.com).


# Some Highlights 

<!-- ## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal. -->

<!-- ## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/). -->

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as an **Analytics Engineer** at Aruna. What we are doing, basically, is helping the stakeholders on making informed decision based on data. I can not explained what I do in detail here due to NDA signed. But, I can tell you that we are also doing some automations here and there to improve some processes in terms of reducing time and quantity for manual and non-manual processes. I have also successfulyy mentored interns during my time here at Aruna.

<!-- ## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content. -->
